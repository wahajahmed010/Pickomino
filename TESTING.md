# Testing

## Framework
[pytest](https://pytest.org/) 8.x (pytest 9 is not supported).

## Test Suite
The test suite is maintained in a private submodule. Contributors requiring
access should contact the maintainer.

## Running Tests
Tests are run automatically via GitHub Actions on every push and pull request.
PRs from forks will not trigger CI — contact the maintainer for access.

## Pre-commit
A subset of checks runs via pre-commit hooks on every commit. Tests also run
via pre-commit, but at the `pre-push` stage rather than on every commit.

## Coverage
95%+ test coverage is maintained and enforced in CI.

## Test Categories

### Fast Tests
- Location: `tests/`
- Purpose: Smoke tests — catch regressions quickly.
- Assert basic invariants, input validation, no crashes.

### Rules Tests
- Location: `tests/`
- Purpose: Verify Pickomino game rules are correctly implemented.
- Each test name describes the rule it verifies.
- Example: `test_bust_returns_top_tile_and_removes_highest_from_table`

## Naming Convention

```
test_<rule_or_behavior_described_in_plain_english>

Good: test_bot_stops_when_collecting_worm_reaches_tile
Bad:  test_step_valid_action
```
