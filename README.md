## Description

An environment conforming to the **Gymnasium** API for the dice game **Pickomino (Heckmeck am Bratwurmeck)**
Goal: train a Reinforcement Learning agent for optimal play. Meaning, decide which face of the dice to collect,
when to roll and when to stop.

## Differences from the Physical Game

If you know the physical game, note the following simplifications:

- **Failed attempt:** the highest tile on the table is removed, not turned face-down.
- **Tile selection:** the best reachable tile is always taken automatically, you cannot
choose a lower-valued tile like in the physical game.
- **Stealing:** always performed when possible, you cannot choose.
- **Win condition:** determined correctly when playing manually with GUI (most worms wins, ties
broken by highest tile). When training without a renderer, no winner is declared
use total reward as your metric. But care, stolen tiles do not reduce your reward,
total reward can exceed your final score.
- **Stack height:** not included in the observation (visible in the physical game).

## Action Space

The action space is `MultiDiscrete([6, 2])`. The `step()` method accepts both
the ndarray returned by `action_space.sample()` and a plain Python tuple.

`action = (die_face (0–5), action_type (0=roll, 1=stop))`

| Index | die_face                                                                     | action_type                              |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 0–5   | Die face to collect: 0→1 eye, 1→2 eyes, 2→3 eyes, 3→4 eyes, 4→5 eyes, 5→worm | —                                        |
| 0–1   | —                                                                            | 0 = roll again, 1 = stop and take a tile |

## Observation Space

The observation is a `dict` with four keys:

| Key            | Min | Max | Shape                |
|----------------|-----|-----|----------------------|
| dice_collected | 0   | 8   | (6,)                 |
| dice_rolled    | 0   | 8   | (6,)                 |
| tiles_table    | 0   | 1   | (16,)                |
| tile_players   | 0   | 36  | (number_of_players,) |

There are eight dice, each with faces 1–5 plus a worm. The worm is a sixth
distinct die face, but it scores 5 points. The same as the 5-eye face — so it
is not a sixth distinct point value.

**Note:** There are eight dice to roll and collect. A die has six sides with the number of eyes one through
five, but a worm instead of a six.
The values correspond to the number of eyes, with the worm also having the value five (and not six!).
The 16 tiles are numbered 21 to 36 and have worm values from one to four spread in four groups.
The game is for two to seven players. Here your Reinforcement Learning Agent is the first player. The
other players are computer bots.
The bots play, according to a heuristic. When you create the environment,
you have to define the number of bots.

For a more detailed description of the rules, see the file pickomino-rulebook.pdf.
You can play the game online here: https://www.maartenpoirot.com/pickomino/.
The heuristic used by the bots is described here: https://frozenfractal.com/blog/2015/5/3/how-to-win-at-pickomino/.

## Rewards

The goal is to collect tiles in a stack. The winner is the player, which at the end of the game has the most worms
on her tiles. For the Reinforcement Learning Agent a reward equal to the value
(worms) of a tile is given when the tile is picked. For a failed attempt
(see rulebook), a corresponding negative reward is given. When a bot steals your
tile, no negative reward is given. Hence, the total reward at the end of the game
can be greater than the score.

For the full rules see the [Pickomino rulebook](https://github.com/smallgig/Pickomino/raw/main/pickomino-rulebook.pdf)

## Info Dictionary

The `info` dictionary is returned at every step. It is intended for debugging and
logging, not for learning.

| Key                    | Type                                 | Description                                                    |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `dice_collected`       | `list[int]`                          | Counts of each die face collected this turn                    |
| `dice_rolled`          | `list[int]`                          | Counts of each die face in the current roll                    |
| `terminated`           | `bool`                               | Whether the episode has terminated                             |
| `truncated`            | `bool`                               | Whether the game was truncated due to the last action          |
| `tiles_table_vec`      | `numpy.ndarray[int8]`, shape `(16,)` | Binary vector of tiles currently available on the table        |
| `smallest_tile`        | `int`                                | Lowest-numbered tile still on the table                        |
| `explanation`          | `str`                                | Reason for the last termination, truncation, or failed attempt |
| `player_stack`         | `list[int]`                          | All tiles currently held by the agent                          |
| `player_score`         | `int`                                | Agent's current score (sum of worm values)                     |
| `current_player_index` | `int`                                | Index of the player whose turn it is                           |
| `bot_scores`           | `list[int]`                          | Scores of all bots, in order                                   |

## Starting State

* `dice_collected` = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
* `dice_rolled` = [3, 0, 1, 2, 0, 2] Random dice, sum = 8.
* `tiles_table` = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1].
* `tile_players` = [0, 0, 0] (with number_of_bots = 2).

## Episode End

Termination occurs when there are no more tiles to take on the table — Game Over.

### Truncation

Truncation occurs when the agent attempts an illegal action during dice
selection or rolling (for example, selecting a face that was not rolled, selecting a
face already collected this turn, or choosing to roll when no dice remain).
The game continues, and a new valid action is required.

### Invalid Actions

Out-of-range actions (outside [0–5] or [0–1]) raise a `ValueError` and do not
affect the episode state.

### Failed Attempt

A Failed Attempt occurs when the agent fails to secure a tile. If the agent has
a stack of already picked tiles, then the top tile is returned to the table, and a negative
reward is
applied.
If the stack is empty, nothing happens, and the reward is zero. The game continues
— the episode does not end.

## Arguments

These must be specified.

| Parameter        | Type        | Default | Description                                                                                |
|------------------|-------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `number_of_bots` | int         | 1       | Number of bot opponents (1-6) you want to play against                                     |
| `render_mode`    | str or None | None    | Visualization mode:<br/>None (training),<br/>"human" (display), or "rgb_array" (recording) |

## Setup

- Python 3.10–3.14

## Installation

We recommend installing in a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# Windows PowerShell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Windows cmd.exe
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# Windows Git Bash
source .venv/Scripts/activate
pip install pickomino-env
```

Verify your installation:

```bash
pickomino-play
```

## Play manually

Playing a few games manually is a great way to understand the rules and game dynamics
before training a Reinforcement Learning agent. Launch the game with the pygame GUI:

```bash
pickomino-play
```

To play against more bots:

```bash
pickomino-play --number-of-bots=3
```

Valid range: 1–6 bots.

To change the bot play speed, adjust the `RENDER_DELAY` constant in `constants.py`.
A higher value slows the bots down, a lower value speeds them up.

```python
RENDER_DELAY: Final[float] = 2
```

## Usage example

```python
import gymnasium as gym

# render_mode options:
#   None         — no rendering, fastest (default, recommended for training)
#   "human"      — pygame window, requires a display
#   "rgb_array"  — returns RGB array, useful for recording
env = gym.make("Pickomino-v0", render_mode="human", number_of_bots=2)

# Reset and get initial observation
obs, info = env.reset(seed=42)

# Run one episode
terminated = False
truncated = False
total_reward = 0

while not terminated and not truncated:
    # Agent selects action: (die_face, roll_choice)
    action = env.action_space.sample()  # Random action for demo
    # Step environment
    obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)
    total_reward += reward
    if truncated:
        print(f"Invalid action: {info['explanation']}")

print(f"Episode finished. Total reward: {total_reward}")
env.close()
```
