# Security & Bug Bounty Policy

## Pickomino — Reinforcement Learning Environment

Pickomino is an open source Reinforcement Learning environment for the board game
Pickomino/Heckmeck, confirmed as an external environment in
[Farama Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/).

This is a small, part-time personal project. The bug bounty program is run in good
faith and on a best-effort basis. Please read this document carefully before reporting.

-----

## Supported Versions

Only the latest tagged release is supported. Bug bounty rewards apply to bugs reproducible on the latest tagged release only. `main` is a work in progress and not eligible.

-----

## Reward

Valid bug reports are rewarded with **one physical copy of the Pickomino/Heckmeck board
game**, shipped via Amazon.de Prime to any destination covered by Amazon.de Prime
shipping.

> **Rewards are limited both per unique bug and per person.** For each unique issue,
> only the first valid report is eligible for a reward, and duplicate reports are not
> eligible. Each person may receive at most one reward in total, even if they report
> multiple unique bugs.

-----

## Scope

### In scope

- Incorrect implementation of Pickomino game rules
- Observation space or action space definition errors
- Reward function inaccuracies
- Non-compliance with the Farama Gymnasium API
- Dependency vulnerabilities (in `pyproject.toml`)
- Reproducibility or random seeding issues
- Packaging and release pipeline issues

### Out of scope

- The GitHub platform itself
- The Farama Gymnasium core library
- Feature requests framed as bugs
- Performance optimisation suggestions
- Theoretical or unproven issues without a reproducer
- Issues found by automated scanners run without prior permission

-----

## How to Report

### Security-sensitive issues

Use GitHub’s built-in private disclosure:
**Security → Report a vulnerability** (top of the repository page).

### Non-security bugs

Open a regular GitHub Issue and prefix the title with `[BUG BOUNTY]`.

### What to include

Please provide all of the following:

1. **A minimal Python reproducer** — a short script that demonstrates the issue
   against a specific tagged version of Pickomino.
2. **Expected behaviour** — what the correct output or behaviour should be, with a
   reference to the Pickomino/Heckmeck rulebook if applicable.
3. **Actual behaviour** — what the environment does instead.
4. **Environment details** — Python version, Gymnasium version, OS.

Reports without a working reproducer may not qualify for a reward.

## Timelines

This is a part-time personal project. Please set expectations accordingly.

| Milestone                                     | Target                |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Initial acknowledgement                       | 30 days               |
| Triage decision (valid / invalid / duplicate) | 90 days               |
| Fix or published workaround                   | 180 days              |
| Public disclosure (security issues)           | After fix is released |

If a milestone is missed, feel free to send a polite follow-up on the issue or
advisory thread.

**Please do not disclose security-sensitive findings publicly before a fix is
released.**

-----

## PR Review Process

PRs are reviewed on a best-effort basis. Expect the same timelines as bug reports. A fix PR should reference the original issue. The maintainer may rewrite or close PRs without notice.

-----

## Rules

- This program is not a legal contract. It operates entirely on mutual good faith.
- Rewards are sent once a fix is merged, or a workaround is published.
- The maintainer reserves the right to adjust reward eligibility or close the program
  at any time, with a notice posted in this file.
- By participating you agree not to exploit any vulnerability beyond what is strictly
  necessary to demonstrate it.
- The maintainer will credit all valid reporters by name (or handle) in the changelog
  and release notes, unless the reporter requests otherwise.

-----

## Contribution Policy

- **No AI-generated contributions.** PRs that are clearly AI-generated slop will be closed without review.
- **No malicious contributions.** Any PR introducing intentional vulnerabilities, backdoors, or sabotage will be rejected and reported.
